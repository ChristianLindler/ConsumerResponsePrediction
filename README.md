## Abstract
This paper introduces a sophisticated tool for
prioritizing consumer complaints in the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
database, utilizing Facebook AI’s large lan-
guage model, RoBERTa. We fine-tuned
RoBERTa on a manually annotated subset of
complaints to identify those with legal signif-
icance, and then fine-tuned two separate in-
stances of the model to predict company pub-
lic and consumer responses. An ensemble ap-
proach combined allowed us to create three
models that specialized in one natural language
task. These insights, combined with complaint
timings, resulted in an algorithm that prioritizes
complaints based on legal relevance, predicted
company public/consumer response, and age.
This method significantly allows complaints to
be handled in an order cognizant to how the
complaint is likely to be handled. Leverag-
ing NLP could optimize financial institution
response quality and resource allocation. The
study demonstrates the efficacy of large lan-
guage models in refining customer service op-
erations in the financial sector.

## Introduction
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a
government agency that writes and enforces rules
for financial institutions, examines financial institu-
tions, monitors and reports on markets, and impor-
tantly, maintains a database of financial product and
service complaints. This database holds consumer
complaints alongside information like the company
type and company response. Complaints in this
database are often deemed invalid after submission
with accordance to federal regulations. The goal
of this project is to develop a complaint screening
tool, providing financial entities a prioritized rank-
ing of outstanding complaints so they can address
the most pertinent first. This should provide a bet-
ter service to consumers with valid concerns and
save company resources by addressing important
complaints promptly. To achieve this we leveraged
the CFPB Complaint Database to fine tune three
large language models for different purposes. We
begin by manually annotating complaints by the
presence of a legal basis, and creating a truth set
for the LLM. We then fine tuned Facebook AI’s
RoBERTa on this truth set to create a domain spe-
cific model, accurate at labeling complaint legality.
Following this, we use a balanced sampling of two
types of company responses to create two further
fine-tuned models. In using an ensemble approach,
we have three models that specialize in in differ-
ent purposes. The outputs of these models as well
as the time of the complaint are given a weight,
creating the scheduling algorithm that determines
priority and sorts the complaints accordingly.

## Background
### CFPB Background information
Our study utilizes data collected by the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a U.S. govern-
ment agency dedicated to making sure consumers
are treated fairly by banks, lenders and other fi-
nancial institutions. The agency owns a database
containing consumer complaints to these institu-
tions. A complaint is formally defined as an issue
or dissatisfaction with reason towards a specific
company’s services or products. When a complaint
is made, it is directed towards the company itself,
usually the customer services department. They are
then responsible for investigating the issue, com-
municating with the consumer, and attempting to
resolve the complaint based on their internal pro-
cedures and policies. Two options arise. If the
consumer is satisfied with the resolution provided
by the company, the matter may be considered re-
solved and the consumer can be considered “satis-
fied”. However, if the consumer believes their com-
plaint remains unresolved, he/she may choose to
escalate the issue further by filing a complaint with
the CFPB. This is important to note as complaints
reaching this database are coming from customers
unsatisfied with the initial resolution.
One specific thing to note about the CFPB is that
a companies frequency of complaints can’t be used
as a sole predictor of regulatory compliance. Fac-
tors like complaint severity, company size, market
share, and geographical population must be added
to the equation. To get a complete picture, it would
be beneficial to combine complaint data from other
public/private databases.
The CFPB maintains the financial complaint
database to analyze the data and provide trans-
parency for consumers, researchers, and the general
public. The CFPB performs their own studies of
the data to identify areas of concern and prioritize
regulatory actions. The public can also search for
information about complaints related to specific
financial products or services, and financial institu-
tions.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
We retrieved complaint data from the CFPB Con-
sumer Complaint Dataset. The dataset can be ac-
cessed by API or CSV/JSON Download and can be
filtered through a graphical interface before down-
load. We downloaded the entirety of the complaint
database and created three different data sets for
our ensemble model approach. We first sampled
900 user complaints for legal-basis annotation. We
then created two cleaned data sets for the training
and testing of the multi-class classification models.
These data sets included only complaints relevant
to that model’s purpose, increasing training effi-
ciency. For instance, complaints with the public
response “Company chose not to provide a public
response” were not used to train the public response
classification model.
### Data Annotation
To annotate the data, we split the sample of 900
complaints into three sections of 300 complaints.
To minimize bias, the complaints were sectioned
such that each was annotated by three different
team members. Each complaint was given two
columns “Law Related” and “Fraud Related”. If a
complaint had some sort of legal basis (IE it was
not a petty concern) we marked it “Law Related”,
and if it was related to some sort of fraud (Identity
Theft, etc.) it was marked “Fraud Related”. Using
a Python script, we recombined these annotations
taking the majority opinion of the three annotators,
creating a truth set to fine tune RoBERTa.
### Legal Basis Classification
We first trained RoBERTa using our custom labels
in order to better label the complaint narrative en-
tries by legal basis. This allows the filtration of
personal gripes with employee service representa-
tives, company application capabilities, and other
less pressing issues. The training dataset consisted
of 810 annotated complaints, and the remaining
90 complaints made up the testing dataset. To en-
hance the performance of our algorithm, we used
AdamW and the loss function. AdamW was used
to correct the weight decay regularization method.
The loss function helped measure the disparity be-
tween our model’s predicted values and the true
values. One change we made to fine tune the model
was integrating learning-rate scheduling to adjust
the learning rate during training. This helped the
model converge faster and avoid overshooting. An-
other change we made was decreasing the batch
size from 32 to 16. This helped improve results as
smaller batch sizes are better suited for smaller data
sets. These two fine tuning changes to our code
resulted in a 3% increase in performance from an
initial 86% accuracy.
### Company Response Prediction
To predict company responses to consumer com-
plaints, the initial dataset was subjected to a series
of preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and
relevance. Two sets were selected representative
subsets of the data to streamline the analysis pro-
cess for the two multi-class models. These subsets
were divided into training, testing, and validation
sets to facilitate the development and evaluation
of our multi-label classification models. Datasets
were handled using Python’s ‘pandas‘ library and
further processed using Hugging Face’s ‘datasets‘
library for efficient manipulation. To further en-
hance the model’s generalizability, the test set was
divided equally into two shards, one serving as the
actual test set and the other as the validation set.
We then fine-tuned the pre-trained RoBERTa
model to adapt to the specifics the CFPB Dataset.
This fine-tuning process allowed RoBERTa to learn
the intricacies and patterns that caused compa-
nies to choose different public/consumer responses.
Each complaint was associated with one or more
types of company responses. To further optimize
the model’s performance, we engaged in hyper-
parameter tuning. This included adjusting learn-
ing rates, batch sizes, and the number of training
epochs. The aim was to find a sweet spot where
the model achieved the highest accuracy without
overfitting the training data. The performance of
the model was rigorously evaluated using a dis-
proportionately large testing dataset. Evaluation is
faster than fine-tuning, so we sought to optimize
our f1 score over a large testing set while train-
ing on only a few thousand complaints. F1-score
was calculated to assess the model’s effectiveness
in correctly classifying the types of company re-
sponses. Through this process, we were able to
achieve an f1 score of .75.
### Priority Ranking
Using the 3 models previously described and the
age of complaints, we created a program capable of
sorting the complaints in a priority order. This au-
tomatic ranking of complaints has potential to save
financial institutions time and money by allowing
them to address the most important complaints first.
We created a weighting function to act upon the
model assigned legality, likely company responses,
and age of a complaint. We can now feed randomly
ordered csv files of complaints to our program, and
receive an output csv with the complaints sorted
and a new column “Has Legal Basis?” as deter-
mined by the legal basis classification model.
The weighting function was made due to heavy
assumptions from our team as to how a financial
institution may want their complaints sorted.
3.6 Spearman’s Rank-order
To test the robustness of our sorting algorithm, we
compared it to a human-like ranking. We tested it
on a ranking of 15 complaints (see next subsection
for more details). We used Spearman’s rank-order
to determine the likeness between two rankings.
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) is cal-
culated using the following equation:
ρ = 1 − 6 ∑ d2in(n2 − 1)
Here, ρ is the Spearman’s rank correlation co-
efficient, di is the difference between the ranks of
corresponding pairs of variables, and n is the num-
ber of data points. Just like the Pearson equivalent
(which tests for linear correlation), the test will
yield a figure of between -1 and +1, and the closer
the figure is to 1, the stronger the monotonic re-
lationship. Spearman’s coefficient is appropriate
for both continuous and discrete ordinal variables,
which is why we used it on our ranking system.

## Conclusion
### Findings
The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient that
we calcualated from our random sampling of 15
complaints came out to be 0.8 between the model's
ranking and the real company response. This is indicates
strong likeness between the model's predictions, the ranking
using given company responses, and human ranking. We acknowl-
edge, however, that there are still improvements to be made
to the program’s ranking.
### Further Work
There are a few potential avenues to further our
work. The largest step forward would to be to part-
ner with a financial institution which could benefit
from our work. If industry professionals ranked a
series of complaints, then we could train a neural
net to form a better weighting algorithm to more
accurately combine our model outputs to create
sorting weights for the final output. Additionally,
we would be able to compare our algorithm to any
currently existing method for the ordering of ad-
dressing complaints. Partnering with such a com-
pany would also allow us to apply our work towards
the initial complaints received by these firms rather
than only the complaints elevated to the CFPB.
Another step we could make moving forwards
would be to try and identify trends in complaint
data vs. stock market data. However, some trends
may be masked by the fact that only complaints
raised to the CFPB would get monitored.
Lastly, we will note that we are currently limited
by our use of RoBERTa in that the maximum size
of the complaints we can rank is 512 characters. It
is not too infrequent to receive complaints beyond
this size. Moving forward, we could workout ways
to address such issues, likely leveraging models
capable of larger character sizes.
